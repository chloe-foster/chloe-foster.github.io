            <h2 class="subheader">About Me</h2>
            
            <p>Hello! My name is Chloe Foster, and this is my portal website.</p>
            <p>I'm one of the programming subteam leads for Phoenix Force Robotics (FRC2097), and more or less primarily work on vision processing systems for the team.</p>
            <p>In my free time outside school and robotics, I work on gamedev and a whole slew of personal projects. I've used Game Maker Studio 2 and C++ in the past, but am currently learning Godot. The music I write for my projects has gotten better over my time, but my spritework and overall polish tend to <i>leave something to be desired.</i></p>
            <p>I have anxiety, depression, and severe combined-type ADHD, and probably also other Mystery Things. That being said, I still try my best to get things done in a timely manner. If you want to contact me outside of an academic or work setting, your best bet is via Discord; my non-personal account's tag is [veryoriginalusername#4828].</p>
            <p>On a less helpful but hopefully brighter note: if you want to ruin somebody's day, replace their semicolons with Greek question marks (;) and disable highlighting for it in their IDE.</p>
